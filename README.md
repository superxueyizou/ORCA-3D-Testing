Tesing ORCA-3D algorithm with agent-based simulation and evolutionary search

This is the code for paper "A Testing Method for Multi-UAV Conflict Resolution using Agent-Based Simulation and Multi-Objective Search", and the code for Chapter 7 of the thesis.

To use the code, you need the following dependencies: ORCA_3D_UAV: https://github.com/superxueyizou/ORCA_3D_UAV; MASON: http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/mason/, an agent-based simulation framework; ECJ:http://cs.gmu.edu/~eclab/projects/ecj/, an evolutionary search system in Java.
